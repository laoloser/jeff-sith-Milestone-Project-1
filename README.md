P1BG - MVP Project Planning Worksheet

For this project, a client has asked you to make a web game for one of its divisions. You need to plan some basic aspects of the game in writing below, and youâ€™ll speak with instructors to make sure it can meet MVP (Minimum Viable Product) in the two weeks of the course. 

After that, you'll also copy/write these points into the professionally written README.md file thatâ€™s required for MVP (and which is also important for your own GitHub Portfolio of pinned projects ðŸ˜‰ )
