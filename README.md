# Project: Falling Stars

## Description

In an effort to collect resources, the government is asking for your help.
Using specialized equipment, your task is to collect falling stars and turn them in for a profit.
They are only looking for the most pure stars though, so catch them before they hit the ground and become contaminated.

Using the D F J K keys to catch the stars.


## Deployment

The web game is deployed at https://laoloser.github.io/jeff-sith-Milestone-Project-1/.


## Game Logic

You have 30 seconds to catch as many stars as you can. 
The higher the difficulty the faster, and more frequent will the stars fall, but they'll also be worth a lot more $$


### Post-MVP Plans

XXX Replace the text below as you list with your own text then delete this line. XXX

I'd want to create more objectives, and objects to create. As well as a "collection zone" where it only counts if you collect the stars within a certain area.
